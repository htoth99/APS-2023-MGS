# APS-2023-MGS
Welcome! If you've made it to this site, it means you're enrolled in the pre-meeting metagenomics workshop held at APS 2023. This page will serve as a pre-meeting tool, as well as something you can go back to after the workshop.

You should have recieved an email from the Ohio Supercomputer (OSC) about signing up for an account. Please follow those instructions and gain access to an account as soon as you can, since that link expires. Almost all of the workshop will take place on the OSC, so it is crucial for you to sign up for an account. 

Lastly, it is incredibly important for you to bring your computer to the workshop, as this workshop relies on indivudal computers.
